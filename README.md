Built a c-lisp programming language interpreter and parser in Go programming language. It also had the functionality of evaluating lispâ€™s s-expressions after parsing. 

To run the parser, run the parser.go file using $ go test command, and to run the eval function, run the eval.go file using $ go test command.
